## Project
Docs - AI agent for SQK commands

## Project Description
This project aims to develop an AI-powered agent integrated into Docs that can manage and interact with the platform‚Äôs backend database using natural language commands.

Instead of requiring technical administrators to write manual SQL queries, the AI agent translates natural language prompts into safe, executable SQL commands ‚Äî helping with tasks like reporting, user management, system auditing, and performance monitoring.

By combining NL-to-SQL models with a secure execution layer, the system enables non-technical admins and managers to access, analyze, and manage platform data efficiently, all from within the Docs interface.
